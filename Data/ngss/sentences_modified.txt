About 97 percent of Earth’s water is in the ocean.
Most fresh water is contained in glaciers or underground aquifers.
Only a tiny fraction of Earth’s water is found in streams, lakes, and rivers.
The relative availability of water is a major factor in distinguishing habitats for different living organisms. 
Water participates both in the dissolution and formation of Earth’s materials. 
The downward flow of water, both in liquid and solid form, shapes landscapes through the erosion, transport, and deposition of sediment. 
Shoreline waves in the ocean and lakes are powerful agents of erosion. 
Over millions of years, coastlines have moved back and forth over continents by hundreds of kilometers, largely due to the rise and fall of sea level as the climate changed (e.g., ice ages).
